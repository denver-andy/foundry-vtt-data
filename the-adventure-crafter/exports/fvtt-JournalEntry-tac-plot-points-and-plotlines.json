  "name": "TAC Plot Points & Plotlines",
  "content": "<p>An Adventure is crafted along a series of Turning Points. Each Turning Point either advances a Plotline, concludes a Plotline, or generates a brand new Plotline. Turning Points are the girders of your Adventure that everything else is built upon.</p>\n<p>The building blocks of Turning Points are Plot Points. A Turning Point is determined by generating a number of Plot Points,</p>\n<p>combining the Plot Points into a narrative that makes sense, and combining that with the Plotline and Characters involved to get your Turning Point. Apply an interpretation to come up with an explanation that makes sense within the context of your Adventure.</p>\n<p>It sounds more complicated than it is. The method of generating a Turning Point goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Roll 1d100 on your Plotlines List for the Plotline focused on in this Turning Point. If you currently have no Plotlines for this Adventure, then skip the roll and consider it an automatic result of New Plotline.</li>\n<li>If the Plotline is an existing Plotline, you start by treating this Turning Point as a Plotline Advancement, meaning the action of this Turning Point is to further the story of that Plotline. Later, while rolling for Plot Points, this Turning Point may turn into a Plotline Conclusion.</li>\n<li>Roll Plot Points for your Turning Point. Roll 3d10, with one die designated to determine which Theme your next Plot Point will be drawn from and the remaining two dice giving you a 1-100 result on the Plot Point Table, finding your Plot Point under that Theme. If a Plot Point requires Characters to be Invoked, then roll on the Characters List.</li>\n<li>Continue rolling for Plot Points until you are done, finishing with between two to five Plot Points total for this Turning Point.</li>\n<li>Combine the Plot Points into a meaningful narrative that makes sense to you by considering the Plotline and Characters involved and the context of the Adventure so far, and come up with an interpreted answer as to what it all means for this Turning Point.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Roll for the Plotline</h2>\n<p>Roll 1d100 and consult the Plotlines List. You will get one of three possible results: an existing Plotline that you have already written into the List, a “New Plotline” result, or a “Choose Most Logical Plotline” result.</p>\n<p>If the result is an existing Plotline, this will be the Plotline addressed in this Turning Point. If you’re recording your Adventure using an Adventure Sheet, then write in the Plotline for this Turning Point. At this time you can also update your Plotlines List by writing this Plotline in again since it’s been Invoked, unless it already appears on the list three times. By adding the Plotline again to the List when it’s called upon, it gives the Plotline more weight in the Adventure and a higher chance of appearing in more Turning Points.</p>\n<p>If you get a result of “New Plotline,” then this Turning Point adds a new problem or goal to your Adventure. Leave the Plotline space of the Adventure Sheet blank for this Turning Point until you are done generating the Turning Point and have figured  out what the new Plotline is and have named it. Also, when you have finished generating the results of this Turning Point, add the new Plotline to the Plotlines List.</p>\n<p>A result of “Choose Most Logical Plotline” requires you to choose the most appropriate Plotline for this Turning Point from the already existing Plotlines. If there is only one Plotline, then you have no choice but to select that one. If there are more than one, you may choose the Plotline any way you wish. Maybe you want to do the same Plotline as the previous Turning Point addressed to continue the action, maybe the previous Turning Point suggested that another Plotline should be given attention at this Turning Point, or maybe there’s a Plotline you are most interested in getting back to and you want to make that the focus of this Turning Point.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Advancement or Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If the Plotline you rolled is an existing Plotline, it starts the Turning Point off as a Plotline Advancement. An Advancement pushes the Plotline forward, giving new twists and information for the Player Characters to deal with.</p>\n<p>While rolling Plot Points for this Turning Point, it’s possible for this Turning Point to turn from a Plotline Advancement into a Plotline Conclusion. The first result of the Plot Point Table is “Conclusion,” rolled on a 1-8.</p>\n<p>We’ll discuss more about New Plotlines, Plotline Advancements, and Plotline Conclusions later in this chapter on page 22, All About Plotlines.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Roll on the Plot Point Table</h2>\n<p>You know your Plotline for this Turning Point. Now it’s time to assemble various Plot Points to figure out what, exactly, is happening in this Turning Point.</p>\n<p>The Plot Point Table is large, spanning multiple pages with a couple of hundred Plot Points separated into Themes. To use the Plot Point Table, roll 3d10. One of the dice will be used as a 1d10 to determine the Theme of this Plot Point, while the other two dice will be used as a 1d100 to generate the Plot Point itself. It’s a good idea to use different colored dice so you know which is which when tossing them.</p>\n<p>The 1d10 die for the Theme will tell you which priority Theme of the Adventure this Plot Point is for. Remember at the outset of your Adventure you determined the Themes of this Adventure, ordered by Priority. The Themes are Action, Tension, Mystery, Social, and Personal. The roll of the Theme die will tell you to choose the First, Second, Third, or Fourth/Fifth priority Theme.</p>\n<p>A result of 10 gives you the Fourth and Fifth Themes together. This result is staggered each time you roll it. The first time a 10 is rolled, choose the Fourth Priority Theme. The second time a 10 is rolled, choose the Fifth Priority Theme. When a 10 is rolled again, it’s back to the Fourth Priority Theme, and so on. These results span across Turning Points. For instance, if on the last Plot Point of Turning Point 3 you rolled a 10 and got the Fourth Priority, then when you started Turning Point 4 you rolled a 10 again, the Theme would be the Fifth Priority.</p>\n<p>If you roll a 10 and forget what the last priority Theme was that you selected, then just start the cycle over with the Fourth Priority.</p>\n<p>The other two dice are used to determine your Plot Point from the Plot Point Table. Go down the numbers in the column under the Theme you rolled, and find your Plot Point on the left. Each Plot Point has a title that indicates what it is about and gives you something you can write on the Adventure Sheet. They also include some explanation and sometimes an example. A few Plot Points require additional explanation and will be discussed further in this chapter.</p>\n<p>Some Plot Points will require Characters to be Invoked to go along with the Plot Point. This means the Plot Point directly involves those Characters, and their names would be listed on the Adventure Sheet beside the Plot Point. We will talk about this more later in this chapter.</p>\n<p>Every Turning Point must have no fewer than two Plot Points, and no more than five. This means you will roll five times on the Plot Point table. Some of the rolls will give you a result of “None”. This means there is no Plot Point for the slot you just rolled for and it would be entered on your Adventure Sheet as a “None” on that line. You can have no more than three “None” results. If you roll a fourth, then disregard it and roll again.</p>\n<p>You are done rolling Plot Points for this Turning Point when you have rolled your fifth Plot Point, including the “None” results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Put it All Together</h2>\n<p>At this point you have a Plotline in mind, you know if it’s an Advancement or a Conclusion, and you have anywhere between two and five Plot Points for your Turning Point. Combine all of this and interpret what you think this means for your  adventure. This is your Turning Point.</p>\n<p>For instance, let’s say you’re crafting an Adventure for a group of space-faring explorers aboard the rogue ship Stardrifter. You’re working up a Turning Point, the Plotline is, “Return the rescued hostage home safely.” The crew of the Stardrifter rescued the hostage from a group of pirates after a skirmish earlier in the Adventure. The Stardrifter is making its way through space, trying to avoid the pursuing pirates and return the hostage to her home planet ... and her wealthy family,  opefully with a substantial reward as a result.</p>\n<p>Rolling up the Plot Points, they get the following: A High Energy Gathering, None, None, Bad News, and Escort Duty.</p>\n<p>You decide that this means the crew of the Stardrifter had made arrangements to meet a member of the hostage’s family on a space station at a busy nightclub (A High Energy Gathering). The Player Characters are nervous bringing the hostage off the ship and into the station, fearing the pirates may have agents there, but they were instructed to bring her to the meeting. They bring her, guarding her carefully along the way (Escort Duty). Once they reach the club, however, they find that their point of contact has not shown up, and they learn that the emissary was intercepted by pirates and was killed in space before arriving (Bad News). The Game Master decides to use this Turning Point to show the Player Characters how much danger they are in, and to what lengths the pirates will go to get their hostage back. They also know they have no choice, there are no short cuts: they need to get the hostage all the way home.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Invoking Plotlines &amp; Characters</h2>\n<p>At the beginning, and throughout, the creation of a Turning Point, you will have need to refer to Plotlines and Characters on the Lists. When a Plotline or Character is called upon, they are considered Invoked. This will happen, for instance, at the start of a Turning Point when you determine which Plotline this Turning Point addresses.</p>\n<p>Similarly, during the rolling and determining of Plot Points, many Plot Points will need to refer to Characters. These are determined by rolling on the Characters List. When one or more Characters have been associated with a Plot Point, they are considered to have been Invoked. An Invoked Plotline or Character is considered to be an important element in a Turning Point. The more Plotlines and Characters are Invoked in an Adventure, the more important they become to the Adventure overall. This is represented in The Adventure Crafter by writing the Invoked Plotline or Character down on the Plotlines or Characters List again, earning them another slot on the List whenever they are Invoked in a Turning Point. This means that a specific Plotline and individual Characters can appear in their List more than once, giving them a greater chance of being Invoked again in the future.</p>\n<p>There are a few guidelines to follow when Invoking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Character may be Invoked more than once during a single Turning Point, for instance being Invoked in two separate Plot Points. However, the Character is only written down on the Characters List one time during any given Turning Point where they are Invoked. In other words, a Character is written down on the Characters List for being Invoked during a Turning Point, whether Invoked once or any number of times.</li>\n<li>A Plotline or Character can only appear on a List a maximum of three times through being Invoked. For instance, a Plotline is placed on the Plotlines List when it is first created. In the next Turning Point it gets Invoked, so the Player writes that Plotline down again on the Plotlines List. A couple of Turning Points later it again is Invoked, earning its third placement on the Plotlines List. If the same Plotline gets Invoked in any succeeding Turning Points it will not be recorded on the Plotlines List again since it has already maxed out at three listings. The same goes for Characters. The only exception to this rule are results on the Meta Plot Points table that instruct you to add Plotlines and Characters to the Lists, which can bring you above the usual three listing maximum.</li>\n<li>When a Plot Point Invokes a Character, it means that Plot Point is about that Character. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean it is only about that Character. For instance, a Plot Point that calls for someone to be attacked may cause you to roll to see which Character is attacked. However, you may decide that the Character is the first one attacked, and that the attackers also attack others in the Turning Point. Or maybe you decide that the Character you rolled represents a group of people, and the entire group is attacked. You should follow the logical path that makes the most sense, whether it makes sense to apply a Plot Point only to the Invoked Character or to the Invoked Character and others associated with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Making it Into Something Meaningful</h2>\n<p>At the end of this chapter is the Plot Points table, which sprawls out across 26 pages. Yes, that’s a lot of table (there is also a four page summary of the entire table for quicker reference if you don’t wish to see the full text of each Plot Point). There are hundreds of Plot Points, each with their own descriptions.</p>\n<p>Once you are done making your rolls for a Turning Point, you’re going to end up with a nice little pile of Plot Points, Invoked Characters, and an Invoked Plotline.</p>\n<p>So what do you do with that?</p>\n<p>Interpretation is the key here. Take all that you have rolled and make it meaningful for your Adventure. The Plot Points give you just enough information to be suggestive of adventuring content, but they are not so specific that they can’t be applied to your particular Adventure and Storylines in all kinds of ways. It’s your task as the Gamemaster to hammer all of these results into its final form. There are various ways you can go about doing this, which is discussed more in the chapter Paths Of The Adventure Crafter starting on page 68.</p>\n<p>Later in this chapter we’ll return to the adventurer’s in Kragan Pit for an example of how the Plot Points are turned into something meaningful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>How to Use Turning Points</h2>\n<p>As stated previously, Turning Points are the building blocks of your Adventure. A series of Turning Points associated with a Plotline detail how that Plotline begins, how it develops, and how it ends. One or more Plotlines, each with their own arcs developed through Turning Points, combined make up your total Adventure.</p>\n<p>There are various ways in which you can think of your Turning Points and how to use them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Scripting</h3>\n<p>When you create a series of Turning Points for a Plotline, the end result will appear very linearly scripted. For instance, let’s say you are running a fantasy Adventure and the Plotline is “Rescue the princess from the dragon.” This Plotline ends up being made up of five Turning Points. In each Turning Point something distinct happens. For instance, let’s say the Turning Points end up like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The heroes are hired by King Drundor to rescue his beloved daughter from the dragon Ylogor, who abducted her to spite the King for refusing to pay him tribute.</li>\n<li>The heroes travel through the Fasmore Woods where they encounter and battle cultists who worship Ylogor and wish to hinder the heroes assault on his cavern.</li>\n<li>After getting past the cultists, the heroes have to make their way through the treacherous forest, where they encounter several dangers such as a rickety bridge across a chasm.</li>\n<li>The heroes discover the dragon’s cavern and make their way inside, battling a nest of giant spiders that serve as guardians to their dragon lord’s home.</li>\n<li>The heroes make it to the heart of the cavern and encounter the dragon, where they defeat it in battle and rescue the princess.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here we have a completed Storyline for “Rescue the princess” composed of five Turning Points. The action described is very specific, and this is typical of how the Adventure Crafter works. Each Turning Point will offer detail and specificity. This gives you the clearest picture of a Turning Point, and it is now up to you, as the Gamemaster, how much of this detail you wish to use.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to go with a completely linear and almost fully scripted Adventure, you could go with the results as is. In the example of our band of princess-rescuing heroes, you have the Adventure neatly laid out for you as the GM, ready to run the Players through.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Using Turning Points As Inspiration</h3>\n<p>A level of detail below following a script would be using the Turning Point results as a guideline or inspiration. For instance, in our rescue Adventure, the GM decides that all of these results are the most likely courses of action, but things may change midway through and the GM makes plans for that. The GM may also change details to suit her tastes as the Adventure takes shape in her mind, and she may add additional Scenes and elements to her Adventure to flesh it out more.</p>\n<p>For instance, in the first Turning Point, the GM decides to spice up the initial encounter with the king with an additional event at his palace that involves a Ylogor cultist who attempts to assassinate a Player Character. The GM may decide to do this to add some action to the first Turning Point since there isn’t a lot going on besides setting up the Plotline, and that encounter could also serve as foreshadowing for the troubles they will face later in the woods.</p>\n<p>This encounter was not indicated by The Adventure Crafter, but was inserted by choice by the Gamemaster. When working with the script that the Adventure Crafter provides, you are using it as inspiration and raw material for you to play with as you wish.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the GM may decide to throw additional encounters into the woods or the cavern, inspired by the events generated by the Plot Points. Maybe the GM wants more dangers encountered in the forest, such as a guardian elemental who tries to stop the heroes. Maybe the GM also inserts some passive dangers into the cavern, such as traditional pit traps or the like.</p>\n<p>When using Turning Points as a script for your Adventure, the Turning Points become almost a scene by scene description of events. When using Turning Points as inspiration, you are more likely to insert additional Scenes into your Adventure,  effectively creating your own Turning Points that are inspired by the ones generated by the Adventure Crafter.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Adventure Seeds</h3>\n<p>You don’t have to use The Adventure Crafter to work up an entire Adventure. You can use it to create an Adventure idea, a seed, that you then run with as you please. To do this, you only need to make a couple of Turning Points, or maybe no more than the first one. Make enough Turning Points until you have a workable idea that you can then develop yourself.</p>\n<p>For instance, with our rescue example, the GM may have stopped after the very first Turning Point. This is going to be a classic Adventure about heroes rescuing a princess from an evil dragon. That’s a fairly thin seed, but it is a specific idea that the GM can run with on his own. If he wants more information, he can generate more Turning Points, stopping when he thinks he has enough and his creative juices are flowing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>All About Plotlines</h2>\n<p>Your Plotlines are the challenges and goals the main Characters in your Adventure are facing. They are the problems to solve and the reasons why the Adventure is taking place. Every Turning Point is about a Plotline. We’ve covered how to maintain your Plotlines in the Plotlines List, and how to roll to determine which Plotline will be the focus of a Turning Point. We’re going to look a little closer at the three different ways Plotlines will present themselves in a Turning Point: New, Advancement, and Conclusion.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>New Plotlines</h3>\n<p>A New Plotline occurs when you start an Adventure and have no Plotlines to begin with or, when rolling for a Plotline for a new Turning Point, the Plotlines List gives you a result of “New Plotline”. There are also a couple of Plot Point results that will cause a New Plotline to appear.</p>\n<p>When a Turning Point is about a New Plotline, it is establishing that Plotline in the overall Adventure. Remember that even though all your Plotlines appear in the same Adventure, they are each separate issues for the Characters to resolve. New Plotlines may be connected to a current Plotline, or they may be completely unrelated.</p>\n<p>For instance, in the last chapter’s example of the heroes entering Kragan Pit, the Plotline that developed in the first Turning Point was called, “Deliver the relic.” This is likely going to be the main Plotline for that Adventure, as it is what compels the heroes to enter the caverns and is their mission.</p>\n<p>A few Turning Points later, the Adventure Crafter may call for the formation of a New Plotline. Let’s say by now the Characters are deep within Kragan Pit. They’ve encountered and overcome some dangers and are on their way to fulfilling the primary mission of delivering the relic. In a new Turning Point, they encounter a group of goblins which they slay. The heroes find a villager crumpled on the ground, nearly dead. He says the goblins abducted him and his daughter. He implores the Characters to find and save his daughter before the goblins have her for stew.</p>\n<p>The GM decides that this is the New Plotline: “Save the villager girl.” She would write the new Plotline on the Plotlines List, and now the Adventure has two Plotlines. Future Turning Points may Invoke either Plotline, depending on how the dice land.</p>\n<p>The new Plotline of rescuing the villager has nothing to do with the initial Plotline, but it becomes part of the overall Adventure anyway.</p>\n<p>A few Turning Points later, you may have yet another “New Plotline” result. In this Turning Point, maybe the Characters encounter a chamber with part of the roof caving in. The GM uses this to decide that the Kragan Pit is crumbling the deeper the Characters bring the relic into it, and at some point it will fully collapse. This gives the Characters the added challenge of not only completing their quest, but of also getting out alive. The GM decides to call this New Plotline, “Escape the pit before it collapses,” and writes it on the Plotlines List. This New Plotline is directly related to the first Plotline, but it presents a new challenge to the Player Characters.</p>\n<p>The Players are likely about seven Turning Points into their Adventure by now. You’ll notice that “Deliver the relic” has appeared three times in the List. It may have been Invoked in more than three Turning Points, but a Plotline maxes out at  three entries on the List.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Plotline Advancements</h3>\n<p>As our heroes descend into Kragan Pit and generate more Turning Points, most of the time the Plotline Invoked for a Turning Point is going to be an existing Plotline on the Plotlines List. When this happens, the Turning Point is all about advancing that Plotline, perhaps giving it some new twists and turns or fleshing it out more.</p>\n<p>For instance, the “Deliver the relic” Plotline appeared in the first Turning Point and got the Adventure started. Maybe in Turning Point 2 it was Invoked again. That Turning Point may have been about the heroes fending off a group of goblins as they fire arrows down at them from high up on the walls. A few Turning Points later, “Deliver the relic” may be Invoked again, sending yet another danger at the heroes as they make their way through the Adventure.</p>\n<p>A Turning Point that’s a Plotline Advancement is all about discovering the next turn of events for that Plotline, allowing the Player Characters to take another step toward resolving it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Plotline Conclusions</h3>\n<p>At some point a Plotline is going to end. This happens when you get a result of “Conclusion” on the Plot Points table. This means that this Turning Point is all about the Invoked Plotline coming to a finish. In Kragan Pit, this most likely means the heroes have reached the heart of the cavern and have delivered the relic, concluding the first Plotline.</p>\n<p>When you get a result of “Conclusion,” that is considered to be a Plot Point item itself. You can use it to mean any details that are necessary to help draw your Plotline to an end. For instance, let’s say your Adventure is about a superhero who has been battling a wolfman type of monster in town.</p>\n<p>Through the course of the Adventure, the hero has determined that the wolfman is a scientist named Derrek Raines who accidentally caused his condition, where he turns into the wolfish monster at night and goes on a rampage. Raines, despairing about his condition, is hiding somewhere in town.</p>\n<p>Each night he appears, he is stronger and more ferocious than the night before, giving our hero strong motivation to capture him quickly.</p>\n<p>Through several Turning Points, the hero discovers that Raines is holing up in an abandoned funhouse at the edge of town.</p>\n<p>When rolling for the next Turning Point, the Player gets, “Nowhere to run,” “Remote location,” “Chase,” “Conclusion,” and “None.” As the GM generated the Plot Points, she may have been thinking that “Nowhere to run” means the hero corners Raines in the funhouse, the “Remote location” seems pretty obvious as the funhouse itself. She decides that “Chase” means that, when first discovered, Raines will flee until cornered. Then she rolls “Conclusion,” causing her to rethink this Turning Point a little. Whatever happens in this Turning Point, the wolfman is not going to escape. She decides that this means Raines, once cornered, will not find a way out and he and the hero will have their final, climactic battle.</p>\n<p>Had the GM not rolled “Conclusion,” she might build into the Turning Point a way for Raines to escape so that the chase wouldn’t be over for the hero just yet.</p>\n<p>When a Plotline Concludes, it can be a surprise. You had initially been developing the Turning Point as a  plotline Development, then it turns into a Conclusion. This may cause you to rethink how you’d been conceptualizing your Turning Point up until that time. That’s okay. In fact, this is a good opportunity to talk about ...</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Bringing Order to Your Turning Point</h2>\n<p>As you generate Plot Points, you’ll likely be thinking what they mean and how they fit into your Adventure, but your ideas  may be vague to begin with. New Plot Points will suggest new ideas. There is no hard and fast rule that says you must decide what a Plot Point means as soon as you generate it versus when you are done. It may be preferable to you to wait until you’ve generated all of your Plot Points first, then take a step back and look at them and decide what they all mean.</p>\n<p>Feel free to decide what a Plot Point means and then to change your mind if you get a better idea or if a later Plot</p>\n<p>Point in the Turning Point suggests another course. The creation of a Turning Point should be considered a fluid, active, and evolving exercise, just like the entire creation of your Adventure. It’s as much about your own personal style as it is about mechanical rules, and you should allow yourself to gravitate to what works best for you. Generating Plot Points is kind of like being in a writing room with people discussing ideas for a script. Plot Points are ideas and suggestions being thrown out there to be included in the Scene. You, as the Artistic Director, are in charge of stringing all of these ideas together into something that makes sense.</p>\n<p>Once you decide what a Turning Point is all about, you may want to jot down a few thoughts on the notes section under the Turning Point on the Adventure sheet to remind yourself if it isn’t obvious from the Plot Points when looking back on it later.</p>\n<p>Let’s try an example of a Turning Point developing. We’re back to our Kragan Pit heroes. They are on Turning Point number four, and the Plotline rolled is “Rescue the villager.” The heroes have already been sentenced to enter the pit, they have  lready had a dangerous encounter with goblins firing arrows at them.</p>\n<p>They had the encounter with the roving goblins where they found the dying villager and learned about his abducted daughter.</p>\n<p>Now, deeper into the Adventure, something else happens and the GM needs to determine what it is.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>The 'I Dunno' Rule</h2>\n<p>The Adventure Crafter uses a random process to get results. You use your own imagination, through logic and interpretation, to make sense of the results of that random process. However, sometimes The Adventure Crafter is going to kick something  out to you that either makes no sense or that you just don’t want for your Adventure.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you roll a Plot Point that indicates one Character betrays another, and you roll up two Player Characters betraying each other, this may make no sense to you. For one thing, the Player Characters are controlled by the Players, not the GM, so you can’t really tell them what to do. Also, it maybe just doesn’t work for the Adventure no matter how it’s interpreted.</p>\n<p>In this case, you can invoke the “I Dunno” rule, which is a blanket way of saying, “That makes no sense, let’s forget about it and move on.” Either treat those Plot Point results as “None”, re-roll, or feel free to change it however you wish.</p>\n<p>I would suggest only ignoring random results when it truly makes no sense, you can’t think of any good interpretations for it quickly, or it would somehow wreck your Adventure. It may be tempting to ignore an outcome when you get a result that is a little difficult to interpret. Sometimes it’s worth it to make the extra effort to see how a new piece of the Adventure could possibly fit with the rest. If you still can’t make it work, or the effort is diminishing your enjoyment of creating or running the Adventure, then feel free to toss it aside and move on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Special Plot Points</h2>\n<p>The Plot Points on the 26 pages at the end of this chapter each have a title and a short description. Many of the titles are self explanatory, such as, “A crucial life support system begins to fail.” The description will give more detail, sometimes with examples to illustrate ideas in how to apply it to an Adventure. Also, a description may help you decide if the Plot Point needs to Invoke a Character to attach to it. For instance, the description for Persuasion says, “A Character tries to persuade another Character to do something. This persuasion can take many forms, from pleading with them to threatening them, for instance.” This description makes it clear that two Characters will need to be Invoked for this Plot Point: the Character doing the persuading, and the Character who is the target of the persuasion.</p>\n<p>It won’t always be obvious if a Plot Point needs to Invoke a Character. It’s ultimately up to you if it does or doesn’t. For instance, if you roll the Plot Point “Impending Doom,” you may decide that this applies to all of the Characters in the  adventure or to everyone in the current Turning Point, without any need to check for a specific Character to Invoke.</p>\n<p>Some of the Plot Points are complicated enough that their title and description may not be enough to explain all that the Plot Point is about. In that case, following are a number of Plot Points with additional explanation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The first entry on the Plot Points Table is “Conclusion.” Should you role this, and the Plotline for this Turning Point is a Plotline Advancement (which is the default for an existing Plotline in a Turning Point) it then turns into a Plotline Conclusion. The “Conclusion” is considered a Plot Point in and of itself.</p>\n<p>The reason “Conclusion” is considered a Plot Point itself, and not just a change in condition of the Plotline from Advancement to Conclusion, is that it requires you to engineer the Turning Point to bring about the end of that Plotline. This means the “Conclusion” itself brings elements to the table.</p>\n<p>For instance, let’s say you have an Adventure where a party of WWII soldiers are hunting a beast that has been killing people. The bulk of the Adventure has been about the Player Characters figuring out what’s going on and tracking the monster to its lair. In the process, a Character gets abducted by the monster, giving the Player Characters pressure to locate the beast so they can rescue that person before the monster kills them.</p>\n<p>As the GM rolls up Plot Points for this Turning Point, she gets “A character is attacked in a non-lethal way” and “Rescue” for her first two Plot Points. The Plot Point Invokes one of the Player Characters, Nathan, as being the target of the attack and the beast as being the attacker. The rescue is for Sgt. Coker, the soldier who was taken.</p>\n<p>So far, the GM is thinking that as the Player Characters hunt a bombed out building for the beast (since the Plotline for this Turning Point is “Slay the beast”), the monster makes a quick hit and run attack on Nathan then flees, presumably toward its lair where Sgt. Coker is stashed.</p>\n<p>Then the GM rolls “Conclusion.” This changes things. The Plotline for this Turning Point is “Slay the beast,” so now the GM has to think that this Plotline will be drawn to a conclusion.</p>\n<p>She continues with her original thinking, that the soldiers are exploring a bombed out building and the monster attacks Nathan. It’s a quick hit and run, requiring the Player Characters to chase after it. Like the GM figured, she decides the monster retreats to its lair deeper within the building.</p>\n<p>The next Plot Point she rolls is “The secret to the power.” She already knows, from other events that happened previously in the Adventure, that the monster is supernatural in origin. She decides that its nest has a glowing orb that gives the beast power. The creature abducts humans and encases them in webbing near the orb, which slowly drains away their life essence. This stored power is then the beast’s energy source, making it nearly indestructible.</p>\n<p>The GM decides that the key to killing the beast is destroying the orb. If that’s done, then it dies. She decides that this Turning Point is the culmination of the previous Turning Points, leading the Player Characters to the thing’s lair for the final showdown.</p>\n<p>If the GM had not rolled “Conclusion,” the events may have been similar, but she may have decided that destroying the orb doesn’t kill the monster. Instead, after the Player Characters destroy the orb the monster flees. It is less powerful now and will be easier to hunt.</p>\n<p>Once a Plotline reaches a Turning Point where it is Concluded, cross out that Plotline on all the lines where it’s listed on the Plotlines List. That Plotline is now done. If you roll a Plotline later and get a line that is crossed out, treat it as a “Choose most logical Plotline” result.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Locations</h3>\n<p>Most of the Plot Points can be thought of as fiction tropes. There are lots of entries like “Wanted by the law” and “A secret weapon”. These Plot Points are meant to be evocative of ideas to inspire you, worded specifically enough to make you think of something in particular but also worded generally enough that you can shape the idea into many different forms. There are  some entries, however, that indicate a location instead of a plot concept.</p>\n<p>The Adventure Crafter deals a lot with Plotlines, Characters, Turning Points, the motives of people and the turning of events. What it doesn’t touch on much are locations. Locations are usually assumed to be inferred when you interpret a Turning Point and to come naturally from the other events of the Adventure. Some locations, however, bring with them a certain mood or opportunities for story elements to develop. This is why the Plot Points Table consists of some general locations, such as “Remote location” or “Shady places”.</p>\n<p>When a location Plot Point pops up, enter it on the line of the Adventure Sheet just like any other Plot Point. This Plot Point means the activity of the Turning Point will take place at a location like that indicated by the Plot Point.</p>\n<p>If you roll more than one location Plot Point for the same Turning Point, you can try to either combine the two locations into a single location, or consider that this Turning Point involves some of the action occurring at one location then moving to another. For instance, “Remote location” and “Shady places” may be a magical street corner that can only be accessed by  special doors and is a place where forbidden lore is sold. Or, you may decide that the Turning Point initially takes place in a remote location, let’s say the outskirts of town. The Characters gain a clue there to a mystery they are trying to solve which leads them to a shady place, a hidden nightclub in town where you can only enter if you have the password.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Tone</h3>\n<p>Similar to locations, some Plot Points will suggest a tone for the Turning Point. For instance, the Plot Point “Grisly tone” doesn’t specify anything in particular happening, what it does is indicate that whatever is happening in the Turning Point be given a macabre flavor. Tone Plot Points also take up a slot on the Adventure Sheet just like any other Plot Point.</p>\n<p>An example of how to incorporate a tone into a Turning Point might be if your Turning Point calls for some Characters to encounter someone in a forest who then attacks them. If the GM rolls “Grisly tone” as another Plot Point, he might change the Turning Point a bit and say that the stranger they encounter is wearing blood spattered clothing, implying this encounter is not his first murderous enterprise of the evening.</p>\n<p>There are also a few Plot Points that specify a time of day, such as the Plot Point “At night”. These exist to lend a certain tonal atmosphere to your Turning Point.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Characters</h3>\n<p>Some Plot Points, in their descriptions, will specifically say that the Plot Point applies to one or more Characters. In this case, you need to roll on the Characters List to figure out who the Characters are whom the Plot Point is referring to. However, whether the description of a Plot Point calls for it or not, it is up to you if you need to Invoke a Character for a Plot Point. Generally, if the Plot Point would make no sense unless it was attached to a Character then roll for someone on the Characters List. If it doesn’t make sense unless there are two Characters Invoked ... for instance, if one Character has to be interacting with another ... then roll for two Characters.</p>\n<p>For example, the Plot Point “Character has a clever idea” needs a Character Invoked quite clearly. The Plot Point “Suspicion” needs two Characters Invoked; one Character to be feeling suspicious and another for the first Character to be suspicious of.</p>\n<p>You will rarely Invoke more than two Characters, even if the Plot Point would involve more than the two specific Characters Invoked. Feel free to use your discretion in interpreting what a Plot Point means when it Invokes a Character. The one,  one Character may be the only one involved in that Plot Point, or that Character may represent others.</p>\n<p>For instance, let’s say “Suspicion” was a Plot Point rolled for a Turning Point in a spy Adventure. The Player Characters are undercover agents, acting as art dealers, trying to gain entry into a foreign government’s museum so they can get close to a high ranking official and steal his computer full of secrets. In the Turning Point, the Characters are trying to con their way past a security checkpoint and get into the museum. The GM rolls the Plot Point “Suspicion”, now needing to Invoke two Characters to attach to it. She rolls the first Character, “Foreign agent”. This Character is a catchall Character for any foreign agent, spy, or security officer they may run across. Essentially, the common mooks and grunts of the Adventure. For the second Character, she rolls “Natasha,” one of the Player Character agents. The GM decides that the officer at the security checkpoint is looking over Natasha’s identification and doesn’t like what he sees. The GM decides that the guard is not only suspicious of Natasha, but also of everyone she’s with.</p>\n<p>It’s a judgement call on the part of the GM how far to extend what Invoking a Character actually means. You should allow yourself a lot of leeway to get the most interesting result for your Turning Point and Adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Invoked Character Doesn’t Fit</h3>\n<p>There are some Plot Points that may need an Invoked Character attached to them, but one of a certain variety. For instance, the Plot Point “Fame” calls for a Character who is famous, the Plot Point “An Organization” calls for a Character that’s an organization.</p>\n<p>When this happens, roll on the Characters List as normal. If you get a Character that fits the description, then you’re good to go. If you get a Character who does not fit the description, then you have a few options. You could use the Invoked Character as inspiration and have the Plot Point reflect a Character associated with the one you rolled. For instance, with “Fame”, if you roll a Player Character mage, maybe the Character the Plot Point refers to is a famous wizard this mage idolizes. Your second option is to consider this rolled result to be “Choose most logical character”. Finally, if that doesn’t work, consider the result to be “New Character” and come up with a new Character who does fit the description.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Nonsense Results</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you’re going to get results that make no sense no matter how you interpret them. For instance, if the Plot Point calls for one Character to attack another, and you roll for the Characters and get the same Character twice, there may be no way to spin this where it makes sense.</p>\n<p>Whenever a roll on the Characters List gives you a result you just can’t work with, change that result to “Choose most logical character”.</p>\n<p>If a Plot Point Table gives you a Plot Point that makes no sense when combined with the other Plot Points, then change that result to “None,” wiping it out. If that would leave you with fewer than 2 total Plot Points for the Turning Point, then instead roll for another Plot Point (you need a minimum of 2 Plot Points per Turning Point).</p>\n<p>Having said that, allow yourself to stretch your interpretation of a result before you decide that it’s nonsense. For instance, if a Plot Point says that one Character rescues another one, but the Character doing the rescuing is at a far distant location, maybe the rescue comes in a less obvious fashion. Maybe a group of mercenaries show up and rescue the Character, who discovers that the mercs were hired by the Invoked Character.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Duplicates</h3>\n<p>The Plot Points are purposefully worded generally enough so that they can be interpreted in many ways to fit into your Adventure. They are meant as much as inspiration as they are as instruction. As such, there is usually more than one Plot Point that could be used to describe the same events in an Adventure.</p>\n<p>For instance, “A work related gathering” and “Headquarters” could very likely both describe the exact same event: a group of similarly employed people gathering at a place they commonly gather at.</p>\n<p>Although many Plot Points overlap with each other in their meaning, each still has its own unique flavor that can be used to sway your interpretation. For instance, with “Headquarters” the event pretty much has to take place at a formally recognized headquarters, while “A work related gathering” opens the possibility for a more social gathering and not necessarily at their primary place of work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Characters List Alteration</h3>\n<p>There are a few Plot Points that call for an adjustment to be made on the Characters List. For instance, “A figure from the past” automatically adds a new Character to the Characters List.</p>\n<p>When a Plot Point makes a direct change to the Characters List the description of the Plot Point will clearly state so. These results are uncommon.</p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<h3>Meta Plot Points Table</h3>\n<p>A result of 96-100 on the Plot Points Table will have you roll again on the Meta Plot Points Table. These Plot Points are separated from the main table since their results are rare and are qualitatively different than the main Plot Points. Meta Plot Points alter the Characters List and offer a chance to have combined Plotlines in a Turning Point. The results that impact the Characters List all revolve around increasing a Character’s presence on the List or reducing it, sometimes completely.</p>\n<p>Although Meta Plot Points are still Plot Points and take up a Plot Point slot in a Turning Point, it is optional whether you want the Meta Plot Point to be reflected in the Turning Point or not as actual Adventure events.</p>\n<p>For instance, let’s say we have a group of space explorers hurtling through the cosmos looking for wrecked ships in a battlefield to find valuable salvage. In this Turning Point, the GM has interpreted the various Plot Points rolled to mean that they discover an energy signature on a ship that they investigate only to discover that the energy is emanating from a battledroid that is still active and has gone insane from damage. It attacks the exploration crew as they make their way through the damaged ship.</p>\n<p>At this point, for the last Plot Point of the Turning Point, the GM rolls a Meta Plot Point and gets “Character Steps Up”. She Invokes a Character to apply this to and gets one of the Player Characters. The GM will increase that Character’s presence on the Characters List by writing him in again, and she has the additional option of either working this into the narrative of the Turning Point or not. If she doesn’t, then she proceeds with the Turning Point as already imagined. If she wishes to give story meaning to the Meta Plot Point result, she may decide that the action of the Turning Point focuses on that Character. Maybe  the battledroid hones in on him, for instance.</p>\n<p>Meta Plot Points are unique in this way, that they may or may not have a story impact on the Turning Point. Meta Plot Points primarily exist to change the importance of Characters in an Adventure without them having to be Invoked, and they are the only way that a Character’s presence on the Characters List can be reduced or eliminated.</p>\n<p>The Meta Plot Points that call for a change to a Character listing are Invoking a Character just like any other Plot Point, except that the Character isn’t automatically added to the List again; the Meta Plot Point table will randomize how they are treated on the List. This means you roll on the Characters List to see who this Meta Plot Point affects. Most Meta Plot Points  that pertain to a Character either require that the Character have one or more entries on the Character List removed, or one or more entries added. There are a few rules that apply to Meta Plot Points to help you carry them out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Meta Plot Points that apply to Characters only apply to existing Characters in the Adventure. Results of “New Character” when Invoking a Character for a Meta Plot Point are treated as “Choose The Most Logical Character”.</li>\n<li>If the Character Invoked is a Player Character, and the Meta Plot Point either calls for that Character to be removed completely from the Characters List or to have so many slots removed that they are removed completely, then treat the result as “Choose The Most Logical Character” and choose another Character. A Player Character cannot be removed from the framework of the Adventure in this way. If there are no viable Characters in the Characters List to choose from, then roll again on the Meta Plot Points Table until you get a workable result.</li>\n<li>Although Meta Plot Points Invoke a Character, don’t add the Character to another listing on the Characters List like you would with a normally Invoked Character. The results of the Meta Plot Point table bypass the normal List management for Invoked Characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The “Plotline Combo” result requires you to roll on the Plotlines List for another Plotline to combine with the Turning Point’s original Plotline and make the Turning Point about both of them. It’s possible to get “Plotline Combo” more than once in a Turning Point, calling on you to combine three or even more Plotlines. For instance, going back to our space explorers, let’s say the Plotline for their Turning Point was “Repair the ship.” Earlier in the Adventure, the explorers had a disastrous encounter with pirates that left their vessel badly damaged. They are trying to repair the ship, which is what has brought them to the battle debris in hopes of finding useful spare parts.</p>\n<p>As one of the Plot Points for this Turning Point, the GM rolls “Plotline Combo”. She consults the Plotlines List and rolls on it, getting “Choose The Most Logical Plotline”. As there was only one other Plotline, she has no choice but to choose it. The second Plotline of “Deliver the secret weapon schematics to Admiral Lenn” is Invoked and combined with the first Plotline. The GM thinks about this a bit. This Turning Point was initially about fixing the ship, so it made sense to have it take place in the battlefield to find useful wreckage. Now she needs to figure out a way to incorporate the second Plotline into the Turning Point too. The GM decides that the Character who handled the stolen schematics got a chemical residue left on them that the battledroid can detect. The war machine is focusing on that Character and is now aware of the stolen document, attacking the Character while crying out, “RELINQUISH THE SCHEMATICS OR DIE!”</p>\n<p>If “Plotline Combo” is rolled and there is no additional Plotline on the Plotlines List, then treat it as a “New Plotline”. This can be an opportunity to have an existing Plotline spawn a new Plotline branching out from it in a Turning Point instead of developing separately in another Turning Point.</p>\n<p>For instance, with the example above, maybe when the GM rolled “Plotline Combo” there was no second Plotline to choose from, so she had to make a new one. Based on the events transpiring in the Turning Point, she decides that after the battledroid takes a certain amount of damage, it’s circuits overload and much of its programming and memory is wiped out. This causes the droid to undergo a factory reset, and the Characters realize they can now take the battledroid and attempt to reprogram and retrain it to serve them. This creates the new Plotline of “Retrain the battledroid to serve us.” The GM decides this will be a time consuming and uncertain process, hence why it deserves to be a Plotline all by itself.</p>\n<p>Generating a Turning Point can be involved. You are juggling a lot of details, from a Plotline to multiple Plot Points,  characters, and the overall course of the entire Adventure itself. A result of “Plotline Combo” can make things more complicated. If you get this result and have no idea what to do with it ... maybe the second Plotline rolled has no logical way to have it occur simultaneously with the original Plotline, or you end up with two results of “New Plotline” and you just don’t want to come up with two entirely new directions for the Adventure ... feel free to invoke the I Dunno rule and ignore this  result. If you do this, then treat it as a Plot Point result of “None” and move on. The random results generated by The Adventure Crafter are meant to inspire your creativity, not stifle them, so whenever you feel you have run into a wall ignore the result for the good of the Adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Plot Points Table Reduction</h3>\n<p>The Plot Points Table is big. Really big. It spans 22 pages with a total of 184 Plot Points, each with a description. The  descriptions of each Plot Point will be helpful to explain what the title of the Plot Point means and give you guidance in how to interpret the answer. After some usage, however, you’ll get used to the various Plot Points and you’ll read the descriptions less and less and rely more and more on the titles alone.</p>\n<p>To make rolling on the Plot Points Table faster and easier, at the very end of the pages of tables (starting on page 56) you will find a reduced version of the table. This table, which spans only 4 pages, lists just the titles of each Plot Point and the numbers needed to roll them.</p>\n<p> </p>",

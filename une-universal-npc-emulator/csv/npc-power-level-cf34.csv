Determine the randomness level (“R-level”) of the scene by assigning a numeric value ranging from orderly to chaotic. The R-level can also represent a difficulty level where the higher the R-level the harder the challenges. Roll a d100 to determine the NPC’s power level relative to that of the PC’s using Table 3. For example if the Rlevel is Disarray and a 76 is rolled, the NPC will be Slightly Stronger than the PC’s.

Note that I have mapped the R-Levels to Mythic GME Chaos Factors: Order (1-2), Calm (3-4), Standard (5-6), Disarray (7-8), Chaos (9-0).

Find the NPC focus of the conversation. If possible the NPC Focus should be regarded as pertaining to the PC of the player rolling, the PC that will be speaking, or the party members in general. It may be helpful to put the word “PC’s” or “your” in front of the NPC Focus if there is a question. It is also helpful to narrow the NPC Focus. If “last story” was rolled figure out what the last story was. What happened during the last story that made this NPC want to discuss it?

  "description": "Tread carefully when bestowing flaws and weaknesses on your main villain. It’s ok when you are acting as DM for a group of players, but when you possess this knowledge as a solo player, it can render your villain laughably easy to defeat. Perhaps consider only having this be something that comes into play if an oracle or a set of keywords determines it on the fly. However, having said that, here is a list of possible weaknesses that your villain may possess.",

Through coercion, violence, manipulation, brainwashing or any other means of persuasion, they are attempting to bring as many individuals into their fold as possible. Perhaps they consider themselves to be a godlike figure, or perhaps they are acting as the emissary for an ancient (perhaps even forgotten) god of some kind. They could even see themselves as agents of change to bring an ancient prophecy into effect. Summoning is another common type of this sort of quest. The villain must enact some ritual in order to bring about the return of an ancient, powerful force. Or, perhaps they are opening a gate to another dimension or hellish plane. Either way, there is a definite element of madness and mayhem to this thread. Monster Types: Dragon, fey, fiend, giant, humanoid, undead.",

It’s also the only kind of plot that a beast will become a villain within (i.e., a bear marauding livestock or something similar). It involves an attempt to gain control over an item or resource. Examples could range from a warlord taking a forest to provide timber for siege weapons. It could also include a sorceress stealing an ancient relic that grants her great power. Resource control could also mean stealing treasure of some sort, conducting a heist or stealing a relic. It could also mean that the creature has already obtained the resource / thing, and is now trying to keep it, wielding the control that it bestows.
